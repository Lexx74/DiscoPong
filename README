# How to compile

To compile this project, you will need :
- The Ada_Drivers_Library at https://github.com/AdaCore/Ada_Drivers_Library
- The GNAT tool suite for arm-eabi-elf at https://www.adacore.com/download


On Linux, set the following environment variables.

export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/GNAT/2018-arm-elf/bin
export GPR_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/Ada_Drivers_Library

Then you can just run

make
make flash


# UART

On the STM32F429 discovery board, the UART pins used are
- UART_TX: PA9
- UART_RX: PA10


# Setup

Connect the TX pin of each board to the RX pin of the other.
Boot up both boards, and play ðŸ™‚!

In case of crash, or freeze of one board, or if nothing appears on the screen of
either board, reset the boards. In the latter case do it simultaneously.
